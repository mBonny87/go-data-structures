# Exercise 4: Search

Write a function to search for a specific value in a binary tree. Return true if the value is found; otherwise, return false.

# Exercise 5: Insertion

Write a function to insert a new node with a given value into a binary search tree while maintaining the binary search tree property.

# Exercise 6: Deletion

Write a function to delete a node with a given value from a binary search tree while maintaining the binary search tree property.
Determine the replacement node to take the place of the deleted root node:

If the root node has no left child, replace the root with its right child.
If the root node has no right child, replace the root with its left child.
If the root node has both left and right children, find the _in-order successor_ (the node with the smallest value in the right subtree) or the _in-order predecessor_ (the node with the largest value in the left subtree).
In this case, the in-order successor of the root (value 10) is the node with value 12.
Replace the root node with the selected replacement node.

# Exercise 7: Height

Write a function to calculate the height of a binary tree (the maximum number of edges from the root to a leaf node).

# Exercise 8: Count Nodes

Write a function to count the total number of nodes in a binary tree.

# Exercise 9: Count Leaves

Write a function to count the number of leaf nodes (nodes with no children) in a binary tree.

# Exercise 10: Check Balanced

Write a function to check if a binary tree is balanced, i.e., the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one.

# Exercise 11: Lowest Common Ancestor

Write a function to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

# Exercise 12: Level Order Traversal

Write a function to perform a level-order traversal of a binary tree and print the values of the nodes level by level.

# Exercise 13: Mirror Tree

Write a function to create a mirror image of a binary tree (swap the left and right subtrees).

# Exercise 14: Check Symmetric

Write a function to check if a binary tree is symmetric (its left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree).

# Exercise 15: Convert to Sum Tree

Write a function to convert a binary tree into a sum tree, where each node's value is replaced with the sum of its left and right subtrees.
