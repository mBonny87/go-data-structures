# Singly Linked List

A Singly Linked List is a data structure where each node contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. It allows traversal in one direction, from the head (first node) to the tail (last node).

# Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List is similar to a Singly Linked List, but each node contains an additional reference (link) to the previous node as well. This allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

# Circular Linked List

A Circular Linked List is a variation of a Singly Linked List where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This allows continuous traversal from any node in the list.

# Circular Doubly Linked

List A Circular Doubly Linked List combines the features of a Doubly Linked List and a Circular Linked List. Each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes, and the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
