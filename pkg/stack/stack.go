// # Exercise 1

// Implement the following operations for a Stack:

// Push: Implement a method Push(value int) that adds a new element with the given value to the top of the stack.
// Pop: Implement a method Pop() int that removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
// Peek: Implement a method Peek() int that returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
// IsEmpty: Implement a method IsEmpty() bool that checks if the stack is empty and returns true if it is, false otherwise.
// Exercise 2: Implement a method Size() int that returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

// Exercise 3: Implement a method Clear() that removes all elements from the stack, effectively emptying it.

// Exercise 4: Implement a method Print() that prints the elements of the stack in the order they would be popped, starting from the top.
